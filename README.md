# AI-Projects

Collection fo the projects completed for the UML AI Course COMP 4200.

* P1. Search Strategies
* P2. Multi Agent Search
* P3. Reinforcement Learning

These projects were completed in Python v3.6 due to the autograder file only working in this version of Python. The non-autograder files shoud still run in newer versions of Python but if they dont work then try using v3.6 and it will work then.

Refer to the various commands.txt files for valid commands to run these files. It is assumed that the user is using Windows to run these files, though the only difference between operating systems should be how you run the file from the command line.
